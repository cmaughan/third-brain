# Chris Maughan's Wiki

This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). It is a place where I post blog entries, useful links and other articles.  It is more for me than for you, but you may find interesting things among the links and articles.  There is a complete list of entries [here](https://chrismaughan.com/secondbrain/impulse.html), which is good for searching.

This whole section of the site is just markdown text, converted to a website by [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), a static website generator.  There's a small sprinkling of javascript for the subscription links and styling, but that's about it.  In this way, I can edit this website using Vim on my local machine and push it to github whenever I like.  A github action builds the site automatically.  I can even search and browse it using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

If you want to get in touch, send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cmaughan)

In my day job I work at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com) on graphics tools and technology.  A little more about me [here](https://chrismaughan.com/about).  My personal projects usually revolve around graphics and audio.  I have a long term project to make a live coding tool, along with a built in audio synthesizer.  If you got here some other way, check out the [front page](https://chrismaughan.com) of the site for a selection of projects I've worked on.
