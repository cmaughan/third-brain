Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me,
The Carriage held but just Ourselves,
And Immortality.
*Emily Dickinson*

When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, 
I all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf 
heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon my self and
curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in scope. *Shakespeare*
