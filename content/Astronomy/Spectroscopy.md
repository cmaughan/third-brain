# Spectroscopy

## Atoms

Nucleus 99.8% of the mass $10^{-14}m$, with total diameter $10^{-10}m$ including electron orbits.
Protons and Neutrons held together by _strong nuclear force_.  They have mass about $1.7*10^{-27}kg$ - about 2000 times the mass of an electron (about $9.1*10^{-31}kg$).  The electron is held in place by _electric force_.  Only certain orbits are allowed for electrons.

Angular momentum is quantized.
$$nh = n \frac{h}{2\Pi} = mvr $$

Energy level of orbits:
$$ E_n = -R_H (\frac{1}{n^2}) \tag{Eq. 5.1} $$
_R is the Rydberg Constant_

Rydberg Constant
$$ R = 1.097*10^{7}m^{-1} \tag{Eq. 5.2} $$

Hydrogen spectrum lines between 656.3nm and 364.6nm.  Spectral lines named as greeks: 1st line is $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$.  This is the _Balmer Series_ of lines.

Note the emission line at the red end, accounting for redness in Nebula.

Balmer's formula (wavelength of spectral lines)
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{n^2}) $$

Bohr formula for Hydrogen wavelengths
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R(\frac{1}{N^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}) $$
_(N Inner Orbit, n Outer Orbit)_

N=1 is the Lyman series (ultraviolet) $L_\alpha$

N=3 is the Paschen series (infrared) $P_\alpha$

Or as photo energy of energy transitions
$$ hv = E_m - En = -R_h(\frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}) \tag{Eq. 5.3} $$
_h is planck's constant, v here is 'frequency'_

If energy $E > 0$ then it is a bound-free transition or free-free transition ; becomes ionised.

Excitation is absorption of a photon or collision with another atom. De-Excitation is emission of a photon.

Atoms in a given energy state or level per unit volume:
$$ g_n e^{-\Epsilon/kT} $$
_k is boltzmann's constant, gn is the statistical weight_

See Eq. 5.4 for more detailed info in course notes.  See also Saha's equation for the same thing with Ionisation states in a unit volume (Eq. 5.5 in the course notes)

Ionisation is where a bound-free transition occurs and electron moves to continuum state.  An Ion has a nucleus with unbound electron. n =1 to E=0 is the ionisation potential of the atom.

## Wavelength of $H_\beta$

$$ \Delta E = E_n - E_m = hv = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \tag{Eq.5.6}$$
$$ hv = E_m - En = -R_h(\frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}) \tag{Eq. 5.3} $$

For a transition from 2->4
$$ \Delta E = (-0.850) - (-3.400) eV $$
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} = \frac{6.6261*10^{-34} * 2.9979*10^8}{2.550 * 1.6022 * 10^{-19}} * 10^9nm$$
$$ = 486.2nm $$
