# Arithmetic

## Commutative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$ 5 + 6 = 6 + 5 $$
$$ 5 * 6 = 6 * 5 $$
  
## Associative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$ 3 + (4 + 5) = (3 + 4) + 5 $$
$$ 3 * (4 * 5) = (3 * 4) * 5 $$

## Distributive
**Mult, Left to Right**
$$ 3 * (4 + 5) = (3 * 4) + (3 * 5) $$
$$ 3 * (4 - 5) = (3 * 4) - (3 * 5) $$
**Divide, Right to Left**
$$ (4 + 5) / 3 = (4 / 3) + (5 / 3) $$
NOTE: 
$$ 3 / (4 +5) != (3 / 4) + (3 / 5) $$

## Factors
Any pair of whole numbers are factors of their product.
$$ 3 * 6 = 18 $$
3 and 6 are factors.
For 18, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 9, 6, 18, because:
$$ 1 * 18 = 18 $$
$$ 2 * 9 = 18 $$
$$ 3 * 6 = 18 $$

## Primes
Two factors, one of which is 1, and the number.  That's a prime
Every whole number can be written as a product of prime factors.

## Prime Factorization
Divide by increasingly large prime numbers
$$ 126: $$
$$ 126 / 2 = 63 $$
$$ 63 / 3 = 21 $$
$$ 21 / 3 = 7 $$
$$ 7 / 7 = 1  $$
$$ = 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 $$

## Highest Common Factor
Find the highest number that divides into both numbers
Lay out the prime factorization:
$$ 144 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 $$
$$ 66 = 2             * 3      * 11 $$
$$ HCF = 2 * 3 = 6 $$
Multiply together _all_ common prime factors

> NOTE: Possible to have a single common factor; try 34 & 92

<div id="lcm"/> 

## Lowest Common Multiple
Find the lowest number the numbers divide into 
From above, use all factors from both numbers
[Good diagram here](https://www.cimt.org.uk/projects/mepres/book8/bk8i2/bk8_2i4.htm)

$$ LCM = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 11 = 1584 $$
Check:
$$ 1584 / 144 = 11 $$
$$ 1584 / 66 = 24 $$

## Fractions
$$ 1 \frac{1}{4} $$
This fraction is in its **lowest terms** because common factors include just unity
Ratios occur in fractions with equal denominators.  A **percentage** has 100 as denominator
Multiply a fraction by 100 to turn it into a percentage
$$ \frac{1}{4} * 100 = 25\% $$

## 28. Division of Integers
- Proper fraction; numerator less than denominator (1 /4)
- Improper; top heavy
- Mixed: 
$$ 1  \frac{1}{4} $$

### Multiplying Fractions
$$ \frac{2}{4} * \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2 * 3}{4 * 8} = \frac{6}{32} $$

## 34. Equivalent Fractions
Multiply top and bottom by the same number, get the same
$$ \frac{4}{5} \equiv \frac{12}{15}$$
Reverse the process; divide top and bottom by the same to reduce the fraction to **lowest terms**

## 37. Dividing Fractions
Flip the divider, multiply instead.
$$ \frac{2}{4} \div \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{2}{4} * \frac{8}{3} $$

## 41. Adding Fractions
Find common denominator, using [LCM](#lcm), or just by figuring out a low number.  Then can add
$$ \frac{2}{4} - \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{4}{8} - \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{1}{8} $$

## 58. Significant Figures
0.1345 to 2 Significant figures = 0.13 \
1355 to 2 Significant figures = 1400

## 61. Decimal Places
0.0035 to 2 decimal places = 0.0035 \
0.2356 to 2 decimal places = 0.24A

### Decimals as Fractions
$$ 1.224 =  \frac{1224}{1000} \equiv \frac{153}{125} $$

## 70. Unending decimals
Put a dot over first and last number that repeats
$$ 0.183183 \equiv 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
Any unnending repeating form can be a fraction.
Convert to a fraction:
$$ 1000x = 183.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ x = 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ 1000x - x = 183.\dot{1}8\dot{3} - 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ 999x = 183 $$
$$ x = 183 / 999 $$

## 72. Rational, Irrational and Real Numbers
Fractions are rationals.  Irrationals don't work as fractions.
e.g.
$$ \sqrt{2} \equiv 0.14121...  $$
$$ \Pi \equiv 3.14159... $$
Irrational and Rational numbers encompass all Real numbers.

## 78. Powers
$$ 2^3 \equiv 2 * 2 * 2 $$
$$ 3^1 \equiv 3 $$
$$ 3^0 \equiv 1 $$

### Multiplication of same base
Same base to power, can add:
$$ 2^3 * 2^6 \equiv 2^9  $$

Different bases to _not_ work:
$$ 2^4 * 3^5 \neq 2^9 $$

... But different bases with same power:
$$ 2^4 * 3^4 \equiv 6^4 $$
i.e. multiply base, keep power

### Division
$$ 5^6 \div 5^2 \equiv 5^4 $$
Same as mult; need the same base

### Negative Powers
$$ 6^{-2} \equiv \frac{1}{6^2} $$
Because:
$$ 6^{-2} = 6^0 - 6^{-2} = 6^0 \div 6^2  = \frac{1}{6^2} $$

### Power products
Multiply the powers
$$ (5^2)^{3} \equiv 5^6 $$

## 93. Fractional Powers and Roots
Odd roots are unique
$$ 6^{1/3} \equiv Unique \equiv 1.817 $$
Even roots are not unique
$$ 6^{1/4} \equiv 2\ OR -2 $$
Odd roots of negative are also negative
$$ -32^{1/5} \equiv -2 $$
Even root of negative number cannot be found (yet)
$$ -3^{1/4} $$

### Integer powers of 10
$$ 0.01204 * 10^4 \equiv 120.4 $$
$$ 1.2 * 10^{-2} \equiv 0.012 $$

## 97. Precedence of powers
Evaluate powers before precedence rules

## 99. Standard Form
Express any integer as a number between 1 and 10 (**mantissa**)
$$ 57.3 = 5.73 * 10^1 $$
Multiply/divide numbers by evaluating mantissas and adding or subtracting powers
$$ 0.84 * 23000 = (8.4 * 10^-1) * (2.3 * 10^4) = 19.32*10^3 $$
For add/subtract, make the powers the same:
$$ 4.72 * 10^3 + 3.648 * 10^4 \equiv 4.72 * 10^3 + 36.48 * 10^3 $$
$$ (4.72 + 36.48) * 10^3 $$

### Preferred Standard Form
$$ 5.2746 * 10^4 $$
Powers of 3 for 'preferred'; i.e. up to 3 digits before the point
$$ 52.746 * 10^3 $$
ENG key on the Casio calculator \
SCI mode is for working in standard form

### Example in standard
$$ (4.72 * 10^2) * (8.36 * 10^5) = 39.4592 * 10^7 = 3.94592 * 10^8 $$
### And in preferred standard:
$$ 394.592 * 10^6 $$

## 106. Error check
Convert to standard form, estimate:
$$ 800.120 * 0.007953 \approx 8 * 10^2 * 8 * 10^-3 = 64 * 10^-1 = 6.4 $$

## 107. Accuracy
The smallest significant figures is all you can expect from an answer based on measured values.
$$ 19.1 * 0.0053 \div 13.345 = 0.00758561 $$ 
in 2 figures: 0.0076 

## 112. Denary (base 10)
$$ 10^3 10^2 10^1 10^0 . 10^{-1} 10^{-2} 10^{-3} $$

## 113. Binary (base 2)
$$ 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0 . 2^{-1} 2^{-2} 2^{-3} $$

## 114 Octal (base 8)
$$ 8^3 8^2 8^1 8^0 . 8^{-1} 8^{-2} 8^{-3} $$

## 116 Duodecimal (base 12)
Extra symbols X and // ? How to do this in latex? 
$$ 12^3 12^2 12^1 12^0 . 12^{-1} 12^{-2} 12^{-3} $$

## 117 Hexadecimal (base 16)
Extra symbols ABCDEF
$$ 16^3 16^2 16^1 16^0 . 16^{-1} 16^{-2} 16^{-3} $$

## 120 Alternative method
Take each digit, multiply by the base, add to the next digit and multiply again, etc.  Just add the final number for the decimal point.
For the bit after the point, multiply by the minus power of decimal digits.
See 120 in stroud for a good diagram.

## 130 Change from Denary to a new base
Succesively divide by the base of the new number, and keep the remainder, then read the remainders in reverse.
12 in Octal
$$ 12 / 8 = 4, 1 / 8 = 1  (14) $$

## 133 Change Denary decimal
This time multiply the decimal part by th new base, then discard the bit before the decimal.
In base 8
$$ 0.526 * 8 = 4.208, .208 * 8 = 1.664.... $$
The answer is 0.41..

## 135 Convert both parts
We do the whole number part (130) and then the decimal part (133) and then squash them together

## 137 Octals for binary and hex
Convert to Octal first, then convert each digit to 3-entry binary digits: 5 = 101.  That's the binary equivalent.  Then regroup the binary digits working outward from the center point into groups of 4 to get the hex digits.
The same process works backwards from octal to hex/binary (147)
